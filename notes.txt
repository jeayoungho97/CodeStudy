    Solved my first BaekJoon silver problems.

    Feel like getting used to coding in c++.

    Week 0 and Week 1 studies are doing their work.

    Solving mainly Psum, Permutation, Split problems.

    & 0 -> off
    & 1 -> 그대로

    | 0 -> 그대로
    | 1 -> on

    ^ 0 -> 그대로
    ^ 1 -> switch

    2 -> 000000...0010
    1 -> 000000...0001
