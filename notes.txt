    First upload to Github.

    Studied "Absorbing Markov Chain" in the morning. (MIT OCW)

    Preparing moving to a new house in the afternoon.

    Finally got the time to study alogithms.

    Happy to be back!

Date : 19/Feb/2025

    Solved my first BaekJoon silver problems.

    Feel like getting used to coding in c++.

    Week 0 and Week 1 studies are doing their work.

    Solving mainly Psum, Permutation, Split problems.

Date : 20/Feb/2025

    Finally free from cleaning and organizing our new home.

Date : 5/April/2025

    Finally starting week4. Haven't been leaving notes since Feb 20th but now I'll keep it on.
    -> Notes about each problem, each week and concepts.

    Bit-Masking
    ------------
    turning off idx bit. -> S &= ~(1 << idx)
    (ex) 
    S =  18 // 10010
    idx = 1
    S &= ~(1 << idx)
    S == 16 // 10000
